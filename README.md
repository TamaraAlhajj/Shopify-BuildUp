# Project Fabric
## Find the perfect apparel the fits you the best!
### This is part of the Shopify-BuildUp



## Development Enviroment
Development is done with either a Linux host or WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)

### Android Device Emulator
You can either use the physical device through ADB or Expo, but I recommend using an emulator as it will make the process a lot faster.
